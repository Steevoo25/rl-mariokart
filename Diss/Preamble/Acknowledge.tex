\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
I would first like to express my gratitude to and acknowledge my project supervisor, Leandro Minku. His sustained support and guidance in meetings always brought a wave of relief when I was feeling unsure of my project direction.
Secondly to the many members of the Mariokart Wii TAS community, whose existing efforts in developing cheat codes and a python-embedded emulator made this project possible.
Finally to Benjamin Middleton, who's Deep-RL implementation was an essential fallback due to an error with mine.
