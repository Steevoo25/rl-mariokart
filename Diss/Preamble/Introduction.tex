Real world relevance: results can be applied to real life with accurate enough representation
\\I then formalised the problem as a MDP
\\In order to run my own rl experiments I needed an interface with the game - dolphin emulator allows for python scripts with access to api
\\I then designed a q-learning agent that interacted with this environment
\\ Balance of short vs long term rewards
\\for deep learning Rainbow - framework adapted from Ben Middleton, into to rainbow rl agent
\\motivations - personal interest, performance comparisons - time, computation resources, generalisation capability - run trained agent on unseen track, input robustness - run both agents on 'busy' track, Scalability - when does q-table become too large
