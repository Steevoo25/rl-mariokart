In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been studied extensively, with an apparent exponential growth of publications. Deep Reinforcement Learning (D-RL) accounts for approximately 30 \% of RL publications in the last 5 years. In this paper I formulate a kart racing game as both and RL and Deep-RL problem and compare both approaches to human players, considering trained performance, resource requirements and adaptability.
