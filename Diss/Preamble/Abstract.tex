In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been studied extensively, with an apparent exponential growth of publications as seen in \ref{fig:rl-papers-graph}.Deep Reinforcement Learning (D-RL) accounts for approximately 30 \% of RL publications in the last 5 years. In this paper I explore and compare RL and D-RL approaches to a kart racing game application, considering trained performance, resource requirements and adaptability.
