\chapter{Future Investigations}
\section{both}
Different vehicle combos? - quicker learning in easier vehicle? - does one outperform the other
\\ allow items - access memory location for item - lots of learning possibilities as items have different uses
\\Different tracks - other similar simple tracks - complex tracks -- xyz speed
\\ use minimap - direction and locations
\section{Q-Learning}
Accuracy of state space for q-learning - include additional information\\
speed replaced with frame step? - kart rotation? xyz pos?
\\ Epsilon-greedy policy - consider how many visits there are to a given state and increase chance of taking best accordingly - fewer visits -> more likely to explore, more visits -> more likely to exploit
\\ Evaluation of maximisation step vs average step
\\ Compare with sarsa

\section{Deep-Q}
how much pixel data is needed - decrease processing requirements while maintaining performance
\\ change textures to flat colours - clearly show track boundaries
\\ compare with other DQN improvements
\\ conduct same study as Rainbow \cite{hessel2018rainbow} investigate which extensions to DQN had the most effect
\\ tesseract OCR - using pixel data already, may as well
