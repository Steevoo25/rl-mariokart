\chapter{Deep-RL Implementation}
implementation adapted from benJMiddleton
\cite{BenJMiddleton}
\subsection{Rainbow Specifications}
introduction on what rainbow is: combination of many improvements to DQN

\subsection{Input Processing}
how frame data is processed before going to rainbow

\\pixel data along with same info as q-learning
\\how does removing frameInfo data affect deep-learning performance - pixel vs frameInfo
\\how its processed within rainbow - cnn?
\subsection{Limitations}
lots of processing required - laptop can run traditional at 60fps, but deep at less than 1fps
\\ some python libraries not supported by Dolphin's embedded python
